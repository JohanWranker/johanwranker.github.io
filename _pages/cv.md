## Volvo GTT (2005 -> present)

The work at Volvo is presented in 5 categories since it has been performed in parallel.

### ECU integrator

I have been the lead developer of 3 (generations) of Electronic Control Units (ECU). In that roll I have been participated in all aspects from sourcing of hardware, hardware schema review, low layer interfaces, BSW/OS configuration, application management and integration. The work with those 3 ECUs and all others developed in the team has given me insight into many of the common development issues such as limitation in CPU power, flash management, startup time issues, cache issues, CPU errata.

### Architect SoC development

Design the overall software architecture and manage the capabilities of the SoC, so all the (10+) cores can work together. Setting the short- and long-term plans for the suppliers- and Volvo-teams to enable the platform of the SoC.

### CM/CI/CD champion

A day-to-day work as advocate, promoter and enabler for Continuous Integration as well as the Continuous Delivery flow on AB Volvo. The vision is to enable the "Stairway to heaven" workflow (see Chalmers publications). The initial work was on 3-10 ECUs with the setup automation of unit-test, static code validation, integration, code generation and guidelines. During the last years then the focus has been shifted towards the full Volvo CM/CI/CD handling to influence, try-out, define and interface the enterprise and back-office tools used to manage the full Volvo ecosystem.

### Common build system

Developed the build system used at Volvo with the specific intent to have high automation. The automation part is required in order to overcome the implicit limitations that exists in Classic Autosar and still allow developer driven innovations. At the current time the build system is utilized for 30 build with different workflows supporting wide range of targets and different (team) maturity levels.

### AB Volvo embedded platform management

Specified and manage the AB Volvo common embedded software platform (VAP/CSWC) from the early introduction of Autosar to the today’s mature version. The day-to-day work has been to make the tools scale to accommodate the Volvo needs by using and adding automation interfaces. The Adaptive Autosar (2020 -) has been added to the platform with another setup of specification, purchase and handling.

## Mobitex AB / Ericsson AB / Ericsson Mobile Data Design AB (1998 - 2005)
