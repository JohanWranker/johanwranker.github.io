## Work

I have been working as an embedded software developer for close to a quarter of a century.
I am working at [Volvo Trucks](https://www.volvotrucks.com) with the software platform within the vehicles and the development tools required for it.
The automotive business is in a shift from hardware industry to a software (innovation) driven industry. That change is occurring concurrently with the shift to renewable energy and a lot of new regulations (cyber security and functional safety).
Being part of that journey is inspiring and frustrating.

Starting from 1998 I was part of the mobile-internet revolution,
as a developer in [Mobitex](www.mobitex.com) system.
Using Mobitex and a [RIM](/assets/images/rim.jpg) device I had e-mail in my pocket in year 2000. That was revolutionary to have true 2 way communication in a pocketsize device, with a battery that lasted a month.

## Internet Me

![Statistics of my pod listening](/assets/images/podtrack.svg)  
The statistics from the podcast player tells a reasonably accurate story of my (internet) interests.
American politics is my reality show, series like [House of Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(American_TV_series)) can't match the real thing; the twists and turns of the legal fights are quite something to follow. Cyber security is always interesting.

## AFK topics in short

- Table top games
- Sailing
- Digging (for plants)
- Ice skating

## Private

I am proud to be a husband and the father of great two children, but will keep that private.
