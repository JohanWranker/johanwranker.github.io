## Work

I have been working as an embedded software developer for close to quarter of a century.
During that time things have changed, in my [Mobitex](www.mobitex.com) years I was part of mobile-internet before that was a word.
In the year 2000 I had, via Mobitex system, e-mails in my pocket and communicated that way.

At [Volvo Trucks](https://www.volvotrucks.com) I have been working with the software platform within the vehicles and the development tools required for that.
The automotive business is in a shift from hardware driven industry to an software (innovation) driven as well as the shift to renewable energy.
Being part of that journey is inspiring and frustrating.

## Internet Hobbies

The "Internet me" is interested in Cyber security and the US politics.
My fascination for the US Election started when Donald J Trump became president and then the US politics got so absurd that it became my reality show, series like [House of Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(American_TV_series)) could not match the real thing. From the politics it has more or less transformed into interest for the legal twists and turns.

## Private

I am proud to be a husband and the father of great two children, but will keep that private.
