## Work

I have been working as an embedded software developer for close to quarter of a century.
At [Volvo Trucks](https://www.volvotrucks.com) I am working with the software platform within the vehicles and the development tools required for that.
The automotive business is in a shift from hardware industry to a software (innovation) driven in combination with the shift to renewable energy and at the same time a lot of rules are enforced by the society.
Being part of that journey is inspiring and frustrating.

Starting from 1998 I was part of the the mobile-internet revolution,
as developer in [Mobitex](www.mobitex.com) system.
Using that system I had e-mail in my pocket in year 2000 with the [RIM](/assets/images/rim.jpg), it was the first with a true 2-way communication.

## Internet Me

![Statistics of my pod listening](/assets/images/podtrack.svg)
The statics from the podcast player tells a quite accurate story of my (internet) interests.
American politics is my reality show, series like [House of Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(American_TV_series)) can not match the real thing. The twists and turns of the legal fights are quite something to follow.

## AFK topics in short

- Table top games
- Sailing
- Digging (for plants)
- Ice skating

## Private

I am proud to be a husband and the father of great two children, but will keep that private.
